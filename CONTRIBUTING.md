# Contributing Guidelines

:heavy_check_mark::tada: Let's make code better together - Thanks for taking the time to contribute! :tada::heavy_check_mark:

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to 0x0I Ansible roles, which are hosted in the [0x0I](https://github.com/0x0I?tab=repositories) on GitHub. These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

For general information and guidelines for contributing to these roles and the Ansible community, see the [community page](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/community/).

## Issues
