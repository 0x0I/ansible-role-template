# Contributing Guidelines

:heavy_check_mark::tada: Let's make code better together - Thanks for taking the time to contribute! :tada::heavy_check_mark:

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to 0x0I Ansible roles, which are hosted in the [0x0I](https://github.com/0x0I?tab=repositories) on GitHub. These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

For general information and guidelines for contributing to these roles and the Ansible community, see the [community page](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/community/)

## Issues

New GitHub issues can be [opened](https://github.com/0x0I/ansible-role-template/issues/new) and [tracked](https://github.com/0x0I/ansible-role-template/issues) in a similar fashion as with most Github repositories by making use of the standard Github issue management facilities.

Reference the following issue reporting guide for more details:

#### Type of Issue and Issue State

| Issue Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `enhancement` | Feature requests. |
| `bug` | Confirmed bugs or reports that are very likely to be bugs. |
| `question` | Questions more than bug reports or feature requests (e.g. how do I do X). |
| `feedback` | General feedback more than bug reports or feature requests. |
| `help-wanted` | The Atom core team would appreciate help from the community in resolving these issues. |
| `beginner` | Less complex issues which would be good first issues to work on for users who want to contribute to Atom. |
| `more-information-needed` | More information needs to be collected about these problems or feature requests (e.g. steps to reproduce). |
| `needs-reproduction` | Likely bugs, but haven't been reliably reproduced. |
| `blocked` | Issues blocked on other issues. |
| `duplicate` | Issues which are duplicates of other issues, i.e. they have been reported before. |
| `wontfix` | The Atom core team has decided not to fix these issues for now, either because they're working as intended or for some other reason. |
| `invalid` | Issues which aren't valid (e.g. user errors). |

## Workflow and backlog
